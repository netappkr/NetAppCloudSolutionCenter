Many companies mistakenly think anti-virus is enough to protect against ransomware attacks. 
But cyber criminals will find a way to bypass this.
Attackers could be former employees who already have the right access to the data, 
which can be sold to competitors or published.
 
Konnichiwa, my name is Lisa Lewis. I am a Cloud Insights Specialist at NetApp.
I am here to introduce our product, NetApp Cloud Insights, which can help you fight against ransomware attacks and insider threats.
 
A feature of NetApp Cloud Insights called Cloud Secure, 
monitors who is accessing what files, when, and how in real-time.
 
In the event of a ransomware attack, Cloud Secure quickly detects the attack,
alerts the administrator, takes a snapshot, and blocks the attack in real-time on storage level, using ONTAP's unique feature.
 
Cloud Secure displays which user was attacked, their business department, and contact information, so the user can be immediately contacted to take quick action.
 
Detailed user activities are retained for 13 months.
with Cloud Secure API, a graphical dashboard can easily visualize the insider threats
such as
 
 Deleting lots of files OR 
 Unauthorized file access OR
 Data theft 
 
Cloud Secure offers a 30-day free trial. Please contact me for more information!
 
Let NetApp Cloud Insights help you fight ransomware attacks and data breaches today!
Thank you and arrigatogozaimasu.
